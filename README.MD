# EnvVars for MacOS X

This is a simple AppKit based program to allow a user to divine what environment 
variables are set when they launch a mac program depending on how they launched it. 
As loading it from Xcode is different from AppCode and different from the terminal, the 
```open``` command or from the Finder.
